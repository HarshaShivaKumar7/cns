The first step is to obtain an associate degree in nursing (ADN) or bachelor’s of science in nursing (BSN) degree and then take and pass the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.
A licensed registered nurse (RN) with a qualifying degree may apply to a graduate nursing program with a CNS track. Note that some but not all CNS programs will accept an RN without a BSN degree, so it’s important to understand entrance requirements for each CNS program of interest prior to applying.
After completing a graduate program with a clinical nurse specialist track — either a master of science in nursing (MSN) or doctor of nursing practice (DNP), or (for MSN holders) a post-master’s CNS certificate — a CNS candidate may pursue national and state certifications. The national credentialing entity will depend on a CNS’s chosen population focus; the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) both certify CNSs. States differ in their credentialing procedures and candidates should contact their local board of nursing for more information. After completing both of these credentialing processes, individuals earn the title of clinical nurse specialist, or CNS for short.
